# CNC Machine V3
 
This is a modified version of my previous designed CNC machine. This version uses (GT2) belts and has a larger working area of 50x70 cm or 20x27 inch. I'm also using microstepping now (all three jumpers) on the Arduino CNC shield. The STL files for 3D printing can be found in the STL folder. I mostly print on .2 or .3 mm with infill between 10 and 30%.
